/*
Package sse is a library for working with the HTML5 server-sent events protocol.
It is composed of two subpackages: server and client. As their names suggest, the
first is for creating event streams, and the second is for consuming existing streams.
Under package server another package is found: event. This package is used to create
events that are sent from the server. For client events, the client package provides
the necessary utilities.

This top-level package is only for presentation purposes only. To see how each
package works, read their documentation.
